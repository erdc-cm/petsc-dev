  Description:
    Abstract:
      This is an Arc/Info polygon data set showing the state line boundary,
      including the area extending into Lake Michigan.  Nominal scale is
      1:62,500.  This data set was created in 1984 by Environmental Systems
      Research Institute (ESRI).

    Purpose:
      This data set was created to serve as base map information
      at scales of 1:62,500 or smaller.  Data are not appropriate
      as a geodetic or engineering base.

    Supplemental_Information:
      Updates to the data: Edition 1.0 of these data were reviewed for
      internal logical consistency in March, 1998.  As a result, new tics
      were created.  See logical consistency report and process steps for
      March, 1998 for more details.  The updated data set (this one) is
      edition 1.1.

    Attribute_Accuracy_Report: Not available.

  Logical_Consistency_Report:
    A logical consistency review was performed in March, 1998.
    The following checks were made:

    Data set was DESCRIBED and coverage files listed to determine
    the feature types present.  In this data set, the following feature
    types were found and checked:  polygons, arcs, labels, and nodes.
    The presence of spatial indices was also checked.

    For PAT and AAT files, each ITEM was checked for the following:
    >- DOMAIN of allowable values
    >- adherence of values to the DOMAIN
    >- definition of ITEMS
    >- requirement of all UNIQUE values for an item
    >- logic of ITEMS REDEFINED over other ITEMS
    >- length of ITEM name as regards conversion to shape file

    BUILD statuses of data sets were checked, as were LABELERRORS and
    NODEERRORS (where appropriate), and PROJECTION definition.

    The presence of a BND file was verified.

    The presence and location of TICS were checked.

    Polygon and chain-node topology present.  There are no dangling
    arcs.  There is one polygon label per polygon, except for universe
    polygon.  Boundary values appropriate for map projection
    and map units.  "Fuzzy" tolerance is suitable for nominal scale.
    New tics were added.  See process steps for March, 1998.  There are
    no attribute values outside the appropriate domains.  There are no
    user-defined attributes.

  Completeness_Report:
    In 1995, the state boundary along the Ohio River was
    officially changed, but these changes have not been
    incorporated.  This coverage does include the portion
    of the state boundary that extends into Lake Michigan.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        This is a legacy data set compiled circa 1984.  It is
        assumed that the automation process was typical of that
        for Arc/info geo-data sets, implying digitization from
        source maps, editing and error checking, building for
        topology, and subsequent revision and update.  Specific
        process descriptions prior to 1997 are unavailable,
        other than those listed in the associated Arc/Info log file.
      Process_Date: 1984

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        An internal logical consistency check was performed in March, 1998.
        See entry for logical consistency.  As a result, the following
        changes/updates were made to the data:

        TICS - The data set had no tics.  Ten new tics were added from
        *path_name_suppressed*/quad100, evenly distributed around
        the state.  However, users needing registration tics for use with
        these data (or a subset of these data) should expect to create
        a task-specific tic set, usually based on section corners.
        For detailed review see *path_name_suppressed*/illimap_v1_0_rev.txt.
