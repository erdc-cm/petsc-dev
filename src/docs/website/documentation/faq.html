PETSc can be used with
any kind of parallel system that supports MPI.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> BUT </span>for any decent
performance one needs&nbsp;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>a <span style="font-weight: bold;">fast,
low-latency interconnect</span>; any ethernet, even 10 gigE
simply cannot provide the needed performance.&nbsp;</li>
        <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">high
per-CPU memory performance</span>. Each CPU (core in dual core
systems) needs to have its <span style="font-weight: bold;">own</span>
memory bandwith of roughly 2 or more gigabytes/second. For example,
standard
dual processor "PC's" will <span style="font-weight: bold;">not</span>
provide better performance when the second processor is used, that is,
you will not see speed-up when you using the second processor. This is
because the speed of sparse matrix computations is almost totally
determined by the speed of the memory, not the speed of the CPU. Smart
process to core binding may help you (for example, with mpich hydra
mpiexec.hydra -n 4/8 --binding topo:sockets) <a
 href="http://wiki.mcs.anl.gov/mpich2/index.php/Using_the_Hydra_Process_Manager#Process-core_Binding">http://wiki.mcs.anl.gov/mpich2/index.php/Using_the_Hydra_Process_Manager#Process-core_Binding</a>
OpenMPI also has equivalent functionality, check its documentation.<br>
        </li>
        <li>The software &nbsp;<a href="http://open-mx.org">http://open-mx.org</a>
provides faster speed for ethernet systems, we have not tried it but it
claims it can dramatically reduce latency and increase bandwidth on
Linux system. You must first install this software and then install
MPICH or OpenMPI to use it.</li>

      <p><a name="why-c"><font color="#ff0000">Why is PETSc
programmed in C, instead of
Fortran or C++?</font> </a></p>
      <p>C enables us to build data structures for storing sparse
matrices, solver information, etc. in ways that Fortran simply does not
allow. ANSI C is a complete standard that all modern C compilers
support. The language is identical on all machines. C++ is still
evolving and compilers on different machines are not identical. Using C
function pointers to provide data encapsulation and polymorphism allows
us to get many of the advantages of C++ without using such a large and
more complicated language. It would be natural and reasonable to have
coded PETSc in C++; we opted to use C instead. </p>
      <p><a name="logging-overhead"><font color="#ff0000">Does
all the PETSc error checking and
logging reduce PETSc's efficiency? </font></a></p>
      <p>No, </p>
      <p><font color="#ff0000"><a name="work-efficiently">How
do such a small group of people
manage to write and maintain such a large and marvelous package as
PETSc?</a> </font></p>
      <p>a) We work very efficiently. </p>
      <ol>
        <li>We use Emacs for all editing; the etags feature makes
navigating and changing our source code very easy. </li>
        <li>Our manual pages are generated automatically from
formatted comments in the code, thus alleviating the need for creating
and maintaining manual pages. </li>
        <li>We employ automatic nightly tests of PETSc on several
different machine architectures. This process helps us to discover
problems the day after we have introduced them rather than weeks or
months later. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>b) We are very careful in our design (and are constantly
revising our design) to make the package easy to use, write, and
maintain. </p>
      <p>c) We are willing to do the grunt work of going through
all the code regularly to make sure that <u>all</u>
code conforms to our interface design. We will <u>never</u>
keep in a bad design decision simply because changing it will require a
lot of editing; we do a lot of editing. </p>
      <p>d) We constantly seek out and experiment with new design
ideas; we retain the the useful ones and discard the rest. All of these
decisions are based on <u>practicality</u>. </p>
      <p>e) Function and variable names are chosen to be very
consistent throughout the software. Even the rules about capitalization
are designed to make it easy to figure out the name of a particular
object or routine. Our memories are terrible, so careful consistent
naming puts less stress on our limited human RAM. </p>
      <p>f) The PETSc directory tree is carefully designed to
make it easy to move throughout the entire package. </p>
      <p>g) Our bug reporting system, based on email to <a
 href="../documentation/bugreporting.html">petsc-maint@mcs.anl.gov</a>,
makes it very simple to keep track of what bugs have been found and
fixed. In addition, the bug report system retains an archive of all
reported problems and fixes, so it is easy to refind fixes to
previously discovered problems. </p>
      <p>h) We contain the complexity of PETSc by using
object-oriented programming techniques including data encapsulation
(this is why your program cannot, for example, look directly at what is
inside the object Mat) and polymorphism (you call MatMult() regardless
of whether your matrix is dense, sparse, parallel or sequential; you
don't call a different routine for each format).</p>
      <p>i) We try to provide the functionality requested by our
users.</p>
      <p>j) We never sleep. </p>
      <br>
      <p><a name="complex"><font color="#ff0000">For complex
numbers will I get better performance with C++?</font></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>To use PETSc with
complex numbers you either ./configure with the option
--with-scalar-type complex and either --with-clanguage=c++ or, the
default, --with-clanguage=c. In our experience they will deliver very
similar performance (speed), but if one is concerned they should just
try both and see if one is faster.</p>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p><a name="different"><font color="#ff0000">How come
when I run the same program on the same number of processes I get a
"different" answer?</font></a><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>Inner products and
norms in PETSc are&nbsp;
computed using the MPI_Allreduce() command. In different runs the order
at which values arrive at a given process (via MPI) can be in a
different order, thus the order in which some floating point arithmetic
operations are performed will be&nbsp;different. Since floating point
arithmetic arithmetic is not commutative the computed quantity may be
(slightly) different. Over a run the many slight differences in the
inner products and norms will effect all the computed results. It is
important to realize that none of the computed answers are any less
right or wrong (in fact the sequential computation is no more right
then the parallel ones), they are all equally valid.</p>
The discussion above assumes that the exact same algorithm is being
used on the different number of processes. When the algorithm is
different for the different number of processes (almost all
preconditioner algorithms except Jacobi are different for different
number of processes) then one expects to see (and does) a greater
difference in results for different numbers of processes. In some cases
(for example block Jacobi preconditioner) it may be that the algorithm
works for some number of processes and does not work for others.
      <p><a name="differentiterations"><font color="#ff0000">How
come
when
I
run
the same linear solver on a different number of
processes it takes a different number of iterations?</font></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>The convergence of
many of the preconditioners in PETSc including the the default parallel
preconditioner block Jacobi depends on the number of processes. The
more processes the (slightly) slower convergence it has. This is the
nature of iterative solvers, the more parallelism means the more
"older" information is used in the solution process hence slower
convergence.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><a name="newremotebranches"><font color="#ff0000">How
come I get an hg error indicating "new remote branches" might be
created when I try to push?</font></a><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></p>
      <p>Here is an example:</p>
[linux]% hg push<br>
pushing to https://petsc.cs.iit.edu/petsc/petsc-dev<br>
searching for changes<br>
abort: push creates new remote branches!<br>
      <p>This is almost always an indication that you have done serious
harm to your local repo. If you run hg heads and
there are more than 1 (which causes this), then you know its true.</p>
      <p>Here is how it happens. You make some local changes, but do
not commit. You pull down and it aborts part way because you have
"uncommitted local changes". However, you do not hg rollback.
Instead
you
just hg commit, which creates another
head. This is supposed to be a feature. I think it should have a user
disable.</p>
      <p>Fixing this is complicated. Basically, you clone the repo
before you made head #2, then create the diff for the bad changeset
that made head #2. Apply it to the clone and checkin, then pull the
master.</p>

path of the PETSc home directory (for example, /home/username/petsc). </p>
      <p>b) Set the environmental variable PETSC_ARCH, which
indicates
the configuration on which PETSc will be used.&nbsp; Note that the
PETSC_ARCH is simply a name the installer used when installing the
libraries. There many be several on a single system, like mylinux-g for
the debug versions of the library and mylinux-O for the optimized
version, or petscdebug for the debug version &nbsp;and petscopt for
the
optimized version. </p>

      <p><font color="#ff0000"><a name="use-mpi">Why do you use
MPI</a>? </font></p>
      <p>MPI is the message-passing standard. Because it is a
standard, it will not change over time; thus, we do not have to change
PETSc every time the provider of the message-passing system decides to
make an interface change. MPI was carefully designed by experts from
industry, academia, and government labs to provide the highest quality
performance and capability. For example, the careful design of
communicators in MPI allows the easy nesting of different libraries; no
other message-passing system provides this support. All of the major
parallel computer vendors were involved in the design of MPI and have
committed to providing quality implementations. In addition, since MPI
is a standard, several different groups have already provided complete
free implementations. Thus, one does not have to rely on the technical
skills of one particular group to provide the message-passing
libraries. Today, MPI is the only practical, portable approach to
writing efficient parallel numerical software. </p>
      <p><font color="#ff0000"><a name="mpi-compilers">What do
I do if my MPI compiler wrappers are invalid</a>?</font></p>
      <p>Most MPI implementations provide compiler wrappers (such as
mpicc) which give the include and link options necessary to use that
verson of MPI to the underlying compilers . These wrappers are either
absent or broken in the MPI pointed to by --with-mpi-dir. You can rerun
the configure with the additional option --with-mpi-compilers=0, which
will try to auto-detect working compilers; however, these compilers may
be incompatible with the particular MPI build. If this fix does not
work, run with --with-cc=c_compiler where you know c_compiler works
with this particular MPI, and likewise for C++ and Fortran.</p>

bit int. If your problem&nbsp;</p>
      <ul>

        <li>your matrix might contain more than 2^31 - 1 nonzeros on a

      </ul>
then you need to use this option. Otherwise you will get strange

      <br>
If you can set several nonzeros in a block at the same time, this is
faster than calling MatSetValues() for each <br>
individual matrix entry.<br>
      <br>
It is best to generate most matrix entries on the process they belong
to (so they do not have to be stashed and then shipped to the owning

"wrong" process, just not many.</p>

        <li>First make sure it is truely the time in KSPSolve()

        <li>There must be enough work for each process to

        <li>Make sure the&nbsp; <a href="faq.html#computers">communication

        <li>Check the number of solver iterates with the

iterations when used on
more processes, this is particularly true for block Jaccobi, the

PETSc does NOT do any explicit conversion of single
precision to double
before performing computations;
this it depends on the hardware and compiler what happens. For example,
the compiler could
choose to put the single precision numbers into the usual double
precision registers and then use
the usual double precision floating point unit. Or it could use SSE2
instructions that work directly
on the single precision numbers. It is a bit of a mystery what
decisions get made sometimes.

      <p>I will illustrate this with gdb, but it should be

by obtaining the array. For a Vec v, we can print all local values using</p>
      <p>(gdb) p ((Vec_Seq*)
v-&gt;data)-&gt;array[0]@v-&gt;map.n</p>
      <p>However, this becomes much more complicated for a

the object. For a Vec v and a Mat m, this would be</p>
      <p>(gdb) call VecView(v, 0)</p>
      <p>(gdb) call MatView(m, 0)</p>
      <p>or with a communicator other than MPI_COMM_WORLD,</p>

      </p>
      <p>Totalview 8.8.0 has a new feature that allows libraries to
provide their own code to display objects in the debugger. Thus in
theory each PETSc object, Vec, Mat etc could have custom code to print
values in the object. We have only done this for the most elementary
display of Vec and Mat. See the routine TV_display_type() in

additional source-file:line-number info.<br>
- option '-download-mpich=1' gives valgrind clean MPI - hence the
recommendation.<br>
- Wrt Other MPI impls, OpenMPI should also work. MPICH1 will not work.
Don't know about other MPIs.<br>
- if '-download-mpich=1' is used - mpiexec will be in PETSC_ARCH/bin<br>
'--log-file=valgrind.log.%p' option tells valgrind to store the output
from each proc in a different file [as %p i.e PID, is different for
each MPI proc].<br>
- On Apple you need the additional valgrind option '--dsymutil=yes'<br>

When you declare a large array in Fortran, the operating

Actually this is not surprising. GMRES computes the norm of the
residual at each iteration via a recurrence relation between
the norms of the residuals at the previous iterations and quantities
computed at the current iteration; it does not compute it via directly
|| b - A x^{n} ||. Sometimes, especially with an
ill-conditioned matrix, or computation of the matrix-vector product via
differencing, the residual norms computed by GMRES start to
"drift" from the correct values. At the restart, we compute the
residual norm directly, hence the "strange stuff," the
difference printed. The drifting, if it remains small, is harmless
(doesn't effect the accuracy of the solution that GMRES
computes). </p>
      <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Cure:
There
realy isn't a cure, but if you use a more powerful
preconditioner the drift will often be smaller and less noticeable. Of
if you are running matrix-free you may need to tune the
matrix-free parameters.<br>

      <p>When you link to shared libraries, the function
symbols
from the shared libraries are not copied in the executable. This way
the size of the executable is considerably smaller than when using
regular libraries. This helps in a couple of ways: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) saves disk space when more than one
executable is created, and &nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) improves the compile time immensly,
because the compiler has to write a much smaller file (executable) to
the disk.</p>
      <p><font color="#ff0000"><a name="link-shared">How
do
I
link to the PETSc shared

      <p>By default, the compiler should pick up the shared

for this.</p>
      <p><font color="#ff0000"><a name="link-regular-lib">What

      <p>You would also need to have access to the shared

exeutable without shared libraries by first deleting the shared

      <p><a name="dynamic-shared"><font color="#ff0000">What
is
the

libraries (and difference between shared libraries)</font></a></p>
      <p>PETSc libraries are installed as dynamic libraries
when
the
./configure flag --with-dynamic-loading is used. The difference with
this - from shared libraries - is the way the libraries are used. From
the program the library is loaded using dlopen() - and the functions
are searched using dlsymm(). This separates the resolution of function
names from link-time to run-time - i.e when dlopen()/dlsymm() are
called.</p>
      <p>When using Dynamic libraries - PETSc libraries cannot
be
moved to a different location after they are built. </p>
