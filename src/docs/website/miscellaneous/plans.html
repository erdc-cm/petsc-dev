    <td width="75%" valign="top">We are now developing a major expansion of <strong>PETSc</strong> to provide
       higher level interfaces (equations, meshes and discretizations) for solving PDEs. 
       This package will complement (and, of course, use) the current
       <strong>PETSc</strong> algebraic solver software.</p> 

       To prevent confusion, the current PETSc software, which 
       provides scalable algebraic solvers, will be known as <strong>PETSc-AS</strong> while the new software will 
       be called <strong>PETSc-CS</strong> (for continuous solvers). Both together will be known as <strong>PETSc</strong>.
       </p>

       Current users of <strong>PETSc</strong> will be able to use <strong>PETSc-CS</strong> features,
       but they can continue to only use the current <strong>PETSc</strong> algebraic solvers, 
       <strong>PETSc-AS</strong>, if they desire.</p>

       <strong>PETSc-CS</strong> used to be refered to, by some, as <strong>PETSc 3</strong>; the <strong>PETSc 3</strong>
       name was dropped because it was too confusing.</p> Version numbers between compatible <strong>PETSc-AS</strong> and
       <strong>PETSc-CS</strong> will match.</p>

       <strong>Rationale</strong></p>

       Performance of general purpose algebraic solvers (both linear
       and nonlinear) is fundamentally limited by the lack of
       additional information that can be conveyed to the solver when
       only the matrix entries are available.  Traditionally this has
       meant, for nontrivial models or nontrivial geometries, that if
       one wishes to use a specific special purpose solver (say
       linear, geometric multigrid) a custom code had to be written
       from beginning to end.

       Using object oriented techniques we have improved on this by
       allowing applications to provide only two specific, coarse
       grained pieces of information to our backend multigrid codes (a
       way to compute interpolation between grids and a way to compute
       coarse representations of the operators). Yet, while successful
       for some applications, this is still
       too much of a burden to impose on most end developers. The next
       step is develop a way for users to provide, only locally, the
       minimal extra information needed to automatically generate the
       interpolation and coarse grid operators on the backend. 

       In theory, mathematically, this is easy. In practice, unless one
       requires the user to adopt your package's fundamental approach to
       griding and discretion, which is completely unrealistic, it 
       is unclear how to proceed. Of course, attempting to parse the user's
       code and extract the information directly is just absurd.

       Need to have the package adapt to the application instead of
       the application to the package.
