                 computational sciences, including graph coloring and
                 multigrid coarse grid creation on unstructured meshes.
                 We present an efficient asynchronous maximal
                 independent set algorithm for use on parallel
                 computers, for ``well partitioned'' graphs, that arise
                 from finite element (FE) models. For appropriately
                 partitioned bounded degree graphs, it is shown that the
                 running time of our algorithm under the P-RAM
                 computational model is of $O(1)$, which is an
                 improvement over the previous best P-RAM complexity for
                 this class of graphs. We present numerical experiments
                 on an IBM SP, that confirm our P-RAM complexity model
                 is indicative of the performance one can expect with
                 practical partitions on graphs from FE problems.",
