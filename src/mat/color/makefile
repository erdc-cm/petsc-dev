#  All the Minpack coloring routines have been converted to C with the F2C 
# converter. We do not include in the distribution the original Fortran 77 
# code in the interest of saving disk space. 
#
#  All of the MINPACK routine names have been prefixed with MINPACK
# to prevent name-space pollution.

#  Original Fortran 77 version for Minpack-1
