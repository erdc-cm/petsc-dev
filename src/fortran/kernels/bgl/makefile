# This directory contains some computational kernels written in
# Fortran77.  These are mainly intended to provide high performance for
# COMPLEX arithmetic (since most C++ compilers do not do a good job
# optimizing complex number calculations), but can also be used to
# compare against C versions of the same kernels.
