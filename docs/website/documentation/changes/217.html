  Changed petscengine.h to petscmatlab.h

  added new PETSC_VIEWER_MATLAB for saving variables to Matlab .mat files

  eliminated PetscViewerXXXXType and PetscViewerXXXSetType() replaced with
   PetscViewerFileType and PetscViewerSetFileType()

  If you use MAT_SYMMETRIC as option for MatSetOption() you will likely
need to also use the option MAT_SYMMETRY_ETERNAL otherwise at the next MatAssembly
the matrix will likly lose the symmetry flag.
