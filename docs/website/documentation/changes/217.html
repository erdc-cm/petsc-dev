  Changed petscengine.h to petscmatlab.h

  added new PETSC_VIEWER_MATLAB for saving variables to Matlab .mat files

  eliminated PetscViewerXXXXType and PetscViewerXXXSetType() replaced with
   PetscViewerFileType and PetscViewerSetFileType()

  If you use MAT_SYMMETRIC as option for MatSetOption() you will likely
need to also use the option MAT_SYMMETRY_ETERNAL otherwise at the next MatAssembly
the matrix will likly lose the symmetry flag.

  changed PetscOptionsEList() to return the index of the string selected by the user
  (error if user enters impossible string)

  changed unmodifiedGramSchmidt name to classicalGramSchmidt everywhere.

  Eliminated KSPGMRESIROrthogonalize() now have KSPGMRESSetCGSRefinement() to decide
when to use iterative refinement

 removed its argument from SLESSolve and KSPSolve
