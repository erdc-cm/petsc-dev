    <p><strong><a name="bug-reports"><font color="#FF0000">Where should I send PETSc bug
    reports and questions?</font></a> </strong></p>
    <p>Send all maintenance requests to the PETSc developers via the email address <a href="mailto:petsc-maint@mcs.anl.gov">petsc-maint@mcs.anl.gov</a> . Also, see the file <a href="bugreporting.html">bugreporting. html</a></p>
    <p><a name="petsc-mailing-list"><strong><font color="#FF0000">How can I subscribe to the
    PETSc users mailing list?</font></strong> </a></p>
    <p>You can join the PETSc announcement list by sending email to <a href="mailto:majordomo@mcs.anl.gov">majordomo@mcs.anl.gov</a> with the message,
    &quot;subscribe petsc-announce&quot;. We will update users regarding new releases, changes,
    etc. through this mailing list. </p>
    <p><strong><a name="why-c"><font color="#FF0000">Why is PETSc programmed in C, instead of
    Fortran or C++?</font> </a></strong></p>
    <p>C enables us to build data structures for storing sparse matrices, solver information,
    etc. in ways that Fortran simply does not allow. ANSI C is a complete standard that all
    modern C compilers support. The language is identical on all machines. C++ is still
    evolving and compilers on different machines are not identical. Using C function pointers
    to provide data encapsulation and polymorphism allows us to get many of the advantages of
    C++ without using such a large and more complicated language. It would be natural and
    reasonable to have coded PETSc in C++; we opted to use C instead. </p>
    <p><strong><a name="logging-overhead"><font color="#FF0000">Does all the PETSc error
    checking and logging reduce PETSc's efficiency? </font></a></strong></p>
    <p>Actually the impact is quite small. But if it really concerns you to get the absolute
    fastest rate you can, then edit the file ${PETSC_DIR}/bmake/${PETSC_ARCH}/base.O and
    remove -DPETSC_DEBUG and -DPETSC_LOG. Then recompile the package. We do not recommend this
    unless you have a complete running code that is well tested, and you do not plan to alter
    it. Our measurements never indicate more then a 3 to 5% difference in performance with all
    error checking and profiling compiled out of PETSc. </p>
    <p><strong><font color="#FF0000"><a name="work-efficiently">How do such a small group of
    people manage to write and maintain such a large and marvelous package as PETSc?</a> </font></strong></p>
    <p>a) We work very efficiently. <ol>
      <li>We use Emacs for all editing; the etags feature makes navigating and changing our source
        code very easy. </li>
      <li>Our manual pages are generated automatically from formatted comments in the code, thus
        alleviating the need for creating and maintaining manual pages. </li>
      <li>We employ automatic nightly tests of PETSc on several different machine architectures.
        This process helps us to discover problems the day after we have introduced them rather
        than weeks or months later. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>b) We are very careful in our design (and are constantly revising our design) to make
    the package easy to use, write, and maintain. </p>
    <p>c) We are willing to do the grunt work of going through all the code regularly to make
    sure that <u><strong>all</strong></u> code conforms to our interface design. We will <u><strong>never</strong></u>
    keep in a bad design decision simply because changing it will require a lot of editing; we
    do a lot of editing. </p>
    <p>d) We constantly seek out and experiment with new design ideas; we retain the the
    useful ones and discard the rest. All of these decisions are based on <u><strong>practicality</strong></u>.
    </p>
    <p>e) Function and variable names are chosen to be very consistent throughout the
    software. Even the rules about capitalization are designed to make it easy to figure out
    the name of a particular object or routine. Our memories are terrible, so careful
    consistent naming puts less stress on our limited human RAM. </p>
    <p>f) The PETSc directory tree is carefully designed to make it easy to move throughout
    the entire package. </p>
    <p>g) Our bug reporting system, based on email to <a href="mailto:petsc-maint@mcs.anl.gov">petsc-maint@mcs.anl.gov</a>,
    makes it very simple to keep track of what bugs have been found and fixed. In addition,
    the bug report system retains an archive of all reported problems and fixes, so it is easy
    to refind fixes to previously discovered problems. </p>
    <p>h) We contain the complexity of PETSc by using object-oriented programming techniques
    including data encapsulation (this is why your program cannot, for example, look directly
    at what is inside the object Mat) and polymorphism (you call MatMult() regardless of
    whether your matrix is dense, sparse, parallel or sequential; you don't call a different
    routine for each format).</p>
    <p>i) We try to provide the functionality requested by our users.</p>
    <p>j) We never sleep. </p>
    <p><strong><a name="old-domain-dir"><font color="#FF0000">What happened to the very cool
    &quot;domain&quot; directory that was in previous versions of PETSc and allowed me to
    easily set up and solve elliptic PDEs on all kinds of grids?</font> <font color="#FF0000">I
    can't find it in PETSc</font>.</a></strong></p>
    <p>That code was all written only for sequential machines. We hope to redo it for parallel
    machines using PETSc someday. Domain is no longer available or supported.</p>

    <h3><a name="Installation">Installation</a></h3>
    <p><strong><a name="already-installed"><font color="#FF0000">How do I begin using PETSc if
    the software has already been completely built and installed by someone else?</font> </a></strong></p>
    <p>Assuming that the PETSc libraries have been successfully built for a particular
    architecture and level of optimization, a new user must merely: </p>
    <p>a) Set the environmental variable PETSC_DIR to the full path of the PETSc home
    directory (for example, /home/username/petsc). </p>
    <p>b) Set the environmental variable PETSC_ARCH, which indicates the architecture on which
    PETSc will be used. For example, use &quot;setenv PETSC_ARCH sun4&quot;. More generally,
    the command &quot;setenv PETSC_ARCH `$PETSC_DIR/bin/petscarch`&quot; can be placed in a
    .cshrc file if using the csh or tcsh shell. Thus, even if several machines of different
    types share the same filesystem, PETSC_ARCH will be set correctly when logging into any of
    them. </p>
    <p>c) Begin by copying one of the many PETSc examples (in, for example,
    petsc/src/ksp/examples/tutorials) and its corresponding makefile. </p>
    <p>d) See the introductory section of the PETSc users manual for tips on documentation. </p>
    <p><a name="reduce-disk-space"><strong><font color="#FF0000">The PETSc distribution is SO
    large. How can I reduce my disk space usage?</font> </strong></a></p>
    <p>a) The directory ${PETSC_DIR}/docs contains a set of HTML manual pages in for use with
    a browser. You can delete these pages to save about .8 Mbyte of space. </p>
    <p>b) The PETSc users manual is provided in PostScript and HTML formats in
    ${PETSC_DIR}/docs/manual.ps and ${PETSC_DIR}/docs/manual.html, respectively. Each requires
    several hundred kilobytes of space. You can delete either version that you do not need. </p>
    <p>c) The PETSc test suite contains sample output for many of the examples. These are
    contained in the PETSc directories ${PETSC_DIR}/src/*/examples/tutorials/output and
    ${PETSC_DIR}/src/*/examples/tests/output. Once you have run the test examples, you may
    remove all of these directories to save about 300 Kbytes of disk space. </p>
    <p>d) The debugging versions (BOPT=g) of the libraries are larger than the optimized
    versions (BOPT=O). In a pinch you can work with BOPT=O, although we do not recommend it
    generally because finding bugs is much easier with the BOPT=g version. </p>
    <p>e) you can delete bin/demos and bin/bitmaps </p>
    <p><strong><font color="#FF0000"><a name="petsc-uni">I want to use PETSc only for
    uniprocessor programs. Must I still install and use a version of MPI</a>?</font> </strong></p>
    <p>For those using PETSc as a sequential library, the software can be compiled and run
    without using an implementation of MPI. To do this, edit the file ${PETSC_DIR}/bmake/${PETSC_ARCH}/packages and change the lines that define the location
    of MPI to </p>
    <p>MPI_LIB = ${PETSC_DIR}/lib/lib${BOPT}/${PETSC_ARCH}/libmpiuni.a <br>
    MPI_INCLUDE = -I${PETSC_DIR}/include/mpiuni <br>
    MPIRUN = ${PETSC_DIR}/bin/mpirun.uni </p>
    <p>If you compile PETSc as such, you will be able to run PETSc ONLY on one processor.
    Also, you will be able to run the program directly, without using the mpirun command. </p>
    <p><strong><a name="no-x"><font color="#FF0000">Can I install PETSc to not use X windows
    (either under Unix or Windows with gcc, the gnu compiler)?</font></a></strong></p>
    <p>Yes. Edit the file <em>bmake/${PETSC_ARCH}/petscconf.h</em> and remove the line<br>
    <strong>#define HAVE_X11</strong><br>
    then edit <em>bmake/${PETSC_ARCH}/packages </em>and remove the lines starting with <br>
    <strong>X11_</strong></p>
    <p><strong><font color="#FF0000"><a name="use-mpi">Why do you use MPI</a>? </font></strong></p>
    <p>MPI is the message-passing standard. Because it is a standard, it will not change over
    time; thus, we do not have to change PETSc every time the provider of the message-passing
    system decides to make an interface change. MPI was carefully designed by experts from
    industry, academia, and government labs to provide the highest quality performance and
    capability. For example, the careful design of communicators in MPI allows the easy
    nesting of different libraries; no other message-passing system provides this support. All
    of the major parallel computer vendors were involved in the design of MPI and have
    committed to providing quality implementations. In addition, since MPI is a standard,
    several different groups have already provided complete free implementations. Thus, one
    does not have to rely on the technical skills of one particular group to provide the
    message-passing libraries. Today, MPI is the only practical, portable approach to writing
    efficient parallel numerical software. </p>
    <p><strong><font color="#FF0000"><a name="use-blocksolve">How do I install PETSc using
    BlockSolve, and use it in my code?</a></font></strong></p>
    <p> First, you must install BlockSolve package.&nbsp; Then edit the bmake/${PETSC_ARCH}/packages
    file, and specify the following variables with the correct paths:

</p>
    <p>BLOCKSOLVE_INCLUDE     = -I/home/petsc/software/BlockSolve95/include<br>
    BLOCKSOLVE_LIB         = -L/home/petsc/software/BlockSolve95/lib/libO/${PETSC_ARCH} -lBS95<br>
    PETSC_HAVE_BLOCKSOLVE = -DPETSC_HAVE_BLOCKSOLVE<br>

</p>
    <p>Now to use BlockSolve, on can use MatType MATMPIROWBS&nbsp; (with
    MatCreate() ) or use MatCreateMPIRowbs(). The preconditioners that work with
    BlockSolve are PCILU and PCICC

    <p><strong><a name="long-link-time"><font color="#FF0000">PETSc executables are SO big and
    take SO long to link</font>.</a></strong></p>
    <p>We find this annoying as well. On most machines PETSc now uses shared libraries by
    default, so executables should be much smaller. Also, if you have room, compiling and
    linking PETSc on your machine's /tmp disk or similar local disk, rather than over the
    network will be much faster. </p>
    <p><a name="petsc-options"><strong><font color="#FF0000">PETSc has so many options for my
    program that it is hard to keep them straight.</font></strong> </a></p>
    <p>Running the PETSc program with the option -help will print of many of the options. To
    print the options that have been specified within a program, employ -optionsleft to print
    any options that the user specified but were not actually used by the program and all
    options used; this is helpful for detecting typo errors. </p>

    <p>You can use the option -log_info to get more details about the solution process. The
    option -log_summary provides details about the distribution of time spent in the various
    phases of the solution process. You can use ${PETSC_DIR}/bin/petscview, which is a Tk/Tcl
    utility that provides high-level visualization of the computations within a PETSc program.

    <p>See the Performance chapter of the users manual for many tips on this.</p>
    <p>a) Preallocate enough space for the sparse matrix. For example, rather than calling
    MatCreateSeqAIJ(comm,n,n,0,PETSC_NULL,&amp;mat); call
    MatCreateSeqAIJ(comm,n,n,rowmax,PETSC_NULL,&amp;mat); where rowmax is the maximum number
    of nonzeros expected per row. Or if you know the number of nonzeros per row, you can pass
    this information in instead of the PETSC_NULL argument. See the&nbsp; manual pages for
    each of the MatCreateXXX() routines.</p>
    <p>b) Insert blocks of values into the matrix, rather than individual components.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong><a name="log-summary"><font color="#FF0000">How can I generate performance
    summaries with PETSc?</font> </a></strong></p>
    <p>Firstly, to generate PETSc timing and flop logging, the compiler flag -DPETSC_LOG
    (which is the default) must be specified in the file
    petsc/bmake/${PETSC_ARCH}/base.${BOPT} Then use these options at runtime: -log_summary
    -optionsleft See the Performance chapter of the users manual for information on
    interpreting the summary data. If using the PETSc (non)linear solvers, one can also
    specify -snes_view or -ksp_view for a printout of solver info. Only the highest level
    PETSc object used needs to specify the view option. </p>
    <p><strong><a name="parallel-roundoff"><font color="#FF0000">Why do I get different answers
    on a different numbers of processors?</font> </a></strong></p>
    <p>Most commonly, you are using a preconditioner which behaves differently based upon the
    number of processors, such as Block-Jacobi which is the PETSc default. However, since
    computations are reordered in parallel, small roundoff errors will still be present with
    identical mathematical formulations. If you set a tighter linear solver tolerance (using
    -ksp_rtol), the differences will decrease.</p>

    <p><a name="debug-cray"><font color="#FF0000"><strong>How do I debug on the Cray T3D/T3E?</strong>

    <p>Use TotalView. First, link your program with the additional option -Xn where n is the

    arguments The -a is used to distinguish between totalview arguments and yours. </p>
    <p><strong><a name="start_in_debugger-doesnotwork"><font color="#FF0000">How do I debug if

    <p>For a uniprocessor job, ex1, with MPICH using ch_p4 as the underlying communication
    layer, the procedure is: </p>
    <p>- Create a dummy file with the text &quot;local 0&quot; - </p>
    <p>- Start the debugger directly: gdb ex1 </p>
    <p>- Run with a command such as: run -p4pg dummy </p>
    <p>With MPICH using shmem as the underlying communication layer, the procedure is: </p>
    <p>- dbx ex1 - run -np 3 (other petsc options) . </p>
    <p><a name="debug-hang"><font color="#FF0000"><strong>How do I see where my code is hanging?</strong>
    </font></a></p>
    <p>You can use the -start_in_debugger option to start all processes in the debugger (each
    will come up in its own xterm). Then use cont (for continue) in each xterm. Once you are sure
    that the program is hanging, hit control-c in each xterm and then use 'where' to print a stack
    trace for each process.</p>
    <p><a name="debug-inspect"><font color="#FF0000"><strong>How can I inspect Vec and Mat values when in the debugger?</strong>
    </font></a></p>
    <p>I will illustrate this with gdb, but it should be similar on other debuggers. You can look at
    local Vec values directly by obtaining the array. For a Vec v, we can print all local values using</p>
    <p>(gdb) p ((Vec_Seq*) v->data)->array[0]@v->n</p>
    <p>However, this becomes much more complicated for a matrix. Therefore, it is advisable to use the
    default viewer to look at the object. For a Vec v and a Mat m, this would be</p>
    <p>(gdb) call VecView(v, 0)</p>
    <p>(gdb) call MatView(m, 0)</p>
    <p>or with a communicator other than MPI_COMM_WORLD,</p>
    <p>(gdb) call MatView(m, PETSC_VIEWER_STDOUT_(m->comm))</p>

    <h3><a name="Shared Libraries">Shared Libraries</a></h3>
    <p><font color="#FF0000"><strong><a name="install-shared">Can I install PETSc libraries as
    shared libraries</a>?</strong></font></p>
    <p>Yes. The PETSc installation process installs the regular libraries and builds the
    shared libraries from these regular libraries. The shared libraries are placed in the same
    location as the regular libraries location.</p>
    <p>If you wish to rebuild/update the shared libraries, you can invoke the following
    command from any directory in the PETSc source:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>make BOPT=O shared</em></p>
    <p><a name="why-use-shared"><strong><font color="#FF0000">Why should I use shared
    libraries?</font></strong></a></p>
    <p>When you link to shared libraries, the function symbols from the shared libraries are
    not copied in the executable. This way the size of the executable is considerably smaller
    than when using regular libraries. This helps in a couple of ways: <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) saves disk space when more than one executable is created, and
    &nbsp; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) improves the compile time immensly, because the compiler has to
    write a much smaller file (executable) to the disk.</p>
    <p><a name="delete-shared"><font color="#FF0000"><strong>How do I delete the shared
    libraries?</strong></font></a></p>
    <p>You can delete the shared libraries by invoking the following command from any
    directory in the PETSc source:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>make BOPT=O deleteshared</em></p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000"><strong><a name="link-shared">How do I link to the PETSc shared
    libraries</a>?</strong></font></p>
    <p>By default, the compiler should pick up the shared libraries instead of the regular
    ones. Nothing special should be done for this.</p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000"><strong><a name="error-running-shared">When running my program, I
    encounter an error saying &quot;petsc shared libraries not found</a>&quot;.</strong></font></p>
    <p>By default, PETSc adds the path to the shared libraries to the executable by using
    options supported by the linker. This problem might occur if the linker flag does not work
    properly or if&nbsp; the path to the shared libraries is different when running the
    executable (for example, if the executable is run on a different machine where the file
    system is mounted differently, and the path to the shared libraries is different). One way
    to fix this problem is to add this new path to the <em>DYLIBPATH</em> variable in the file
    ${PETSC_DIR}/bmake/${PETSC_ARCH/packages.&nbsp; Another fix&nbsp; is to add this path to
    the <em>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</em> enviornmental variable.</p>
    <p><a name="dylibpath"><font color="#FF0000"><strong>What is the purpose of the DYLIBPATH
    variable in the file ${PETSC_DIR}/bmake/${PETSC_ARCH}/packages?</strong></font></a></p>
    <p>This makefile variable is used to specify any paths to any other shared libaries used
    by PETSc (or the application), where these shared libraries are NOT present in the system
    default paths in which the dynamic linker searches. These paths are added into the
    executable and are avilable to the dynamic linker at runtime. An example where this is
    useful is if the compiler&nbsp; is installed in a non-standard location, and some of the
    compiler libraries are installed as shared libraries. Multiple paths can be specified in
    the C_DYLIBPATH variable as follows:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C_DYLIBPATH&nbsp; = ${CLINKER_SLFLAG}:path1 ${CLINKER_SLFLAG}:path2</p>
    <p><font color="#FF0000"><strong><a name="link-regular-lib">What If I want to link to the
    regular .a library files</a>?</strong></font></p>
    <p>The simplest way to do this is first to delete the PETSc shared libraries, and then to
    rebuild your executable. Some compilers do provide a flag indicating that the linker
    should not look for shared libraries. For example, <em>gcc</em> has the flag <em>-static</em>
    to indicate only static libraries should be used. But this may not work on all machines,
    since some of the usual system/compiler/other libraries are distributed only as shared
    libraries, and using the <em>-static</em> flag avoids these libraries so that the compiler
    will fail to create the executable.</p>
    <p><a name="move-shared-exec"><font color="#FF0000"><strong>What do I do if I want to move
    my executable to a different machine?</strong></font></a></p>
    <p>You would also need to have access to the shared libraries on this new machine. The
    other alternative is to build the exeutable without shared libraries by first deleting the
    shared libraries, and then creating the executable.&nbsp;<p><a name="dynamic-shared"><font color="#FF0000"><strong>What
    is the deal with dynamic libraries (and difference between shared libraries)</strong></font></a></p>
    <p>PETSc libraries are installed as dynamic libraries when the flag PETSC_USE_DYNAMIC_LIBRARIES
    is defined in bmake/${PETSC_ARCH}/petscconf.h. The difference with this -
    from shared libraries - is the way the libraries are used. From the program
    the library is loaded using dlopen() - and the functions are searched using
    dlsymm(). This separates the resolution of function names from link-time to
    run-time - i.e when dlopen()/dlsymm() are called.<p>When using Dynamic
    libraries - PETSc libraries cannot be moved to a different location after
    they are built.
