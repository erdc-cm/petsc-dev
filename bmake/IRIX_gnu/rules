# Notes:
#
# This version of PETSCFLAGS specifies the use of Fortran kernels (via
# -DPETSC_USE_FORTRAN_KERNELS) for several low-level computational kernels for
# complex numbers rather than using the potentially slower C++ versions.
# To instead use the C++ routines, remove -DPETSC_USE_FORTRAN_KERNELS from this
# list.
