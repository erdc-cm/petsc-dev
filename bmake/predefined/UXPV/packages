#  This file contains site-specific information.  The definitions below
#  should be changed to match the locations of libraries at your site.
#  The following naming convention is used:
#     XXX_LIB - location of library XXX
#     XXX_INCLUDE - directory for include files needed for library XXX
#
# Location of BLAS and LAPACK.  See ${PETSC_DIR}/docs/installation.html 
# for information on retrieving them.
#
# If you are lucky, you may have the DEC Alpha math library installed on 
# your machine. The library name is dxml, and it contains both BLAS and Lapack.

# Location of X-windows software: on most DEC alpha's these are installed in
# the default location and thus one need not edit the below. If they are not
# in the default location, you would put something like
#
# X11_INCLUDE    = -I/home/freeware1/include/X11
