   Fix the bmake and configure way of handling -rpath paths for different compilers. How to do??

   It would be nice if someday configure could get the "compute nodes" to see
   that they have the appropriate shared libraries that are used when compiling
   or otherwise the static libraries are used.

   Do more error checking on user input arguments for nice error messages like if they
   pass a directory for -with-blas-lapack-dir or the other way around

   Change bmake/configure to only do one of C or C++ compiler?
