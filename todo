PETSc configure
   Get version for mpcc_r, mpCC_r, mpxlf_r, absoft F90, intel F90 (ifc and ifort), compaq F90

   Strip newlines from version for PG F90, Intel C/C++

   Test support for requesting 32 bit or 64 bit code

   Fix the bmake and configure way of handling -rpath paths for different compilers. How to do??

   It would be nice if someday configure could get the "compute nodes" to see
   that they have the appropriate shared libraries that are used when compiling
   or otherwise the static libraries are used.

   Do more error checking on user input arguments for nice error messages like if they
   pass a directory for -with-blas-lapack-dir or the other way around

KSP
   Manual pages for KSPConvergedReason

     Add option to KSP to generate error when convergence fails, rather than continuing with ConvergedReason
     Take out calls to SETERRQ directly in KSP solvers and replace with correct ConvergedReason

    Make LSQR properly handle nonzero initial guess by simply computing the residual right hand side; solving
    that and then adding back the initial guess.

    Add support for point block diagonal scaling the matrix before calling KSPSolve.

SNES
   Manual pages for SNESConvergedReason

   Add option to SNES to generate error when convergence fails, rather than continuing with ConvergedReason

   Add _SNESOps function table, dang I can't beleive we don't have it yet

Vectors
   Remove VecLoadIntoVector() and change VecLoad() to take a Vec as input

   Handle special cases of VecAXPBY

   Add vector orthogonalization and move over use from GMRES and MatNullSpace see Jose petsc-maint 9785

Error handling
   Add troubleshooting entries and error messages with web address for common errors.

PC/Mat
  Convert the Tufo-Fischer parallel direct solver to its own PC.

  Manual pages for partitioners

  Add support for ICC for BAIJ by converting to SBAIJ

  Add MatOption POSITIVE_DEFINITE and have KSP default to CG if that plus symmetric set

  Matrix impls should not use MatGetRow() on their own data structures, they should directly address the data structure.

  MatGetRow/ColumnIJ should have const for arrays that are returned

  Add norms for BAIJ matrices

  Make a Mat type of PC and KSP.

  Add MatSolveForward/Back() per Jose petsc-maint 9785

DMMG

   Add DMMGSetNullSpace() to provide single function that sets null space for all levels

   Add manual pages for DMMGGet....

Testing

   We should compare L_2 error estimates when solving PDEs

   We should have performance benchmarking to make sure code performance is not decreased by changes

General

  replace 1 in calls to SETERRQ**() with appropriate error code

  Make --download-mpich get the correct mpich under windows

  add DAVecGatherAll and DAVecGather
  
  keywords in maual pages should get listed in help topic list

  move creations of MPI_op_create() to PetscInitialize() and fortran version and put frees in finalize()
    hmmm, I put the creates in vecinitializepackage but there is no good place to put the frees
    in vecfinalizepackage() and have a PETSc way to register packages that are freed on the end of petsc

  Allow setting precision of printed numbers in ASCII viewers.
