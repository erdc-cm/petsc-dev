PETSc configure
   Test support for requesting 32 bit or 64 bit code

   Download and install c2html if user missing documentation?

   Download sowing (take code from fortranStubs.py) for build docs if 
   requested with --with-sowing-if-needed

   Fix the bmake and configure way of handling -rpath paths for different compilers. How to do??

   It would be nice if someday configure could get the "compute nodes" to see
   that they have the appropriate shared libraries that are used when compiling
   or otherwise the static libraries are used.

   Do more error checking on user input arguments for nice error messages like if they
   pass a directory for -with-blas-lapack-dir or the other way around

   Change bmake/configure to only do one of C or C++ compiler

Vectors
   Remove VecLoadIntoVector() and change VecLoad() to take a Vec as input

Error handling
   Add troubleshooting entries and error messages with web address for common errors.

PC/Mat
  Convert the Tufo-Fischer parallel direct solver to its own PC.
