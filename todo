  allow matrix to share another matrices stuff and its stored numerical values petscmaint 12168

  for configure optional external packages, write a package independent rule to check if the
  user wants the package installed and if all stuff it needs is available. See hypre.py
  for a template. Put the rule up in the ../../PETSc directory

  count for PSSetUpOnBlocks() is wrong, since it always has to call in, since it
  does not know if the setup was done.

  all Raise RuntimeError() in configure that are intended for users 
should have instead self.framework.Box('message','url') that formats the 
message with ** around it for users to see easily.

  Figure out why gmres as smoother for one iteration can be some much better
than Richardson? Is it computing some good damping factor?

  Interface for vectors to fftw.

Before release
   Test PetscInt long long

   configure for all packages, with install option for as many as possible

  keywords in maual pages should get listed in help topic list

  need python tool to find all manual page functions that are missing in the users manual.

  print error message at the end of make if any error detected in compile

PETSc configure
 
   Make test in compilers.py if compiler is f90 or not

   Get version for mpcc_r, mpCC_r, mpxlf_r, absoft F90, intel F90 (ifc and ifort), compaq F90

   Strip newlines from version for PG F90, Intel C/C++

   Test support for requesting 32 bit or 64 bit code

   Fix the bmake and configure way of handling -rpath paths for different compilers. How to do??

   It would be nice if someday configure could get the "compute nodes" to see
   that they have the appropriate shared libraries that are used when compiling
   or otherwise the static libraries are used.

   Do more error checking on user input arguments for nice error messages like if they
   pass a directory for -with-blas-lapack-dir or the other way around

KSP

   Add new KSP that allows reordering unknowns (parallel or sequential) for better performance
   and then calls regular KSP.

    Add option to KSP to compute and print true residual norm after solve is complete.

     Add option to KSP to generate error when convergence fails, rather than continuing with ConvergedReason
     Take out calls to SETERRQ directly in KSP solvers and replace with correct ConvergedReason

    Make LSQR properly handle nonzero initial guess by simply computing the residual right hand side; solving
    that and then adding back the initial guess.

    Add support for point block diagonal scaling the matrix before calling KSPSolve.

SNES

   Add option to SNES to generate error when convergence fails, rather than continuing with ConvergedReason

   Add _SNESOps function table, dang I can't beleive we don't have it yet

Vectors
   Remove VecLoadIntoVector() and change VecLoad() to take a Vec as input allow setting type before sizes
   provide VecSetMap()

   Handle special cases of VecAXPBY

   Check if indices passed into create are sorted (often they will be); if they are then 
   do much faster check to which processor owns them

   Added VecScatterGetMerged() that tells if the update is done in the begin or end or middle
and fix MatMultTranspose_xxx to handle both beginning and end. Currently gives wrong answer with beginning.

Error handling
   Add troubleshooting entries and error messages with web address for common errors.

PC/Mat

  Change MatLoad() to take a matrix, move sizes out of MatCreate(), add MatSetMaps(), allow setting type before sizes

  Use blocksize in MPIAIJ to create faster scattergather for mat-mult and pass in getsubmatrices for faster
  in ASM.

  Add PCShellSetContext()/GetContext() and remove the ctx and ctxrich passed into setapply and setapplyrichardson()
  indicates limits on context from Fortran. (Make like MatShell())

  Manual pages for mat ordering/coloring/partitioning types
  Manual pages for partitioners

  Modify PC_MG to allow setters and fold DMMG and ML (and maybe hypre) into it?

  Fix MatGet/RestoreRow/ColumnIJ() to have an additional flag indicating if one may change the
ia and ja data. Then the reoordering codes need to check that flag since Sparsepack corrupts the data.

  Fix all MatPartitioners to optionally turn on edge weights from the matrix values.
  Currently the are ignored for all partitioners except parmetis, where they are 
  incorrectly always used.

  + (Satish) Convert the Tufo-Fischer parallel direct solver to its own PC.


  Add support for ICC for BAIJ by converting to SBAIJ

  Add MatOption POSITIVE_DEFINITE and have KSP default to CG if that plus symmetric set

  Matrix impls should not use MatGetRow() on their own data structures, they should directly address the data structure.

  Add norms for BAIJ matrices

  Make a Mat type of PC and KSP.

  Add MatSolveForward/Back() per Jose petsc-maint 9785

  Add support for i,j,k too large to get ignored just like negative ones get ignored.

DMMG

DM
   General mechanism for DMGetMatrix() etc ...

DA

   Add DAVecGetArrayf90() Hmmm, thought I did this a long time ago?

Testing

   We should compare L_2 error estimates when solving PDEs

   We should have performance benchmarking to make sure code performance is not decreased by changes

General

  Make --download-mpich get the correct mpich under windows

  add DAVecGatherAll and DAVecGather
  

  move creations of MPI_op_create() to PetscInitialize() and fortran version and put frees in finalize()
    hmmm, I put the creates in vecinitializepackage but there is no good place to put the frees
    in vecfinalizepackage() and have a PETSc way to register packages that are freed on the end of petsc

  Allow setting precision of printed numbers in ASCII viewers.
